    I am a young High School Graduate, just got out of High School October, trying to begin my career as a Software Engineer or Developer, I am still exploring the available options, and one of the best options I have found to begin my career is the Kwagei Innovators Training.
    <br>My Nickname is 'Phenom J', I like it because of the meaning it has, if you want to know you can check it out.</br>
    I love Technology, so I wish to contribute to the development of Liberia through Technology. There are a lot of things that are a lot more difficult to happen here in Liberia, and I think the reason for that is that, there are not enough Software Developers to bring about new Ideas and Solutions and help to improve our Nation.

      <h3>
        <b>Experience at the Kwagei Innovators Training</b>
      </h3>
      <br>The Kwagei Innovators Training is the best opportunity I have here in Liberia to begin my career as a Software Developer and get to learn actual Programming.
      I really believe in this Program, and trust that it will provide me all I will need to begin my career and keep learning more and advancing. I also like the fact that the Kwagei Innovators Training is always trying to keep things regulated and setting some rules so that things can be under control.
      I wish to continue the Program and keep doing my best to be timely and apply the best effort and make sure that I get the Success I desire.
